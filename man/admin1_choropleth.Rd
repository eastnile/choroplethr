\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing regional data at the sub-country level for
one or more countries.}

\item{geoid.name}{The variable that identifies each administrative region}

\item{geoid.type}{How the variable given by geoid.name specifies each
country. The allowed geoid.type are given by the columns "adm1_code",
"diss_me", "ne_id" in the output of get_admin1_map(); use this output to
match the names of your regions to the correct geoid. If "auto", the
function will try to automatically determine geoid.type.}

\item{value.name}{The name of the variable you wish to plot.}

\item{num_colors}{The number of colors you want in your graph when plotting
continuous data. If num_colors > 1, the variable in question will be
divided into quantiles and converted into a factor with that many levels.
If num_colors = 1, a continuous color gradient will be used; if num_colors
= 0, a diverging color gradient will be used (useful for visualizing
negative and positive numbers).  Use color.max and color.min to control the
range of colors displayed. num_colors is ignored when plotting categorical
data.}

\item{color.max}{The color of the highest value in your data. Ignored if the
plotted variable is categorical.}

\item{color.min}{The color of the lowest value in your data. Ignored if the
plotted variable is categorical.}

\item{na.color}{The color you want to assign for regions with missing data}

\item{custom.colors}{A vector of valid R color terms of the to use for the
map when plotting factor variables. The length of this vector must match
the number of levels in your factor variable, or num_colors for a
continuous variable that will be discretized by the function, and the order
should match the order of the levels of in your factor variable.}

\item{nbreaks}{The number of breaks you wish to show in the legend when using
a continuous color scale. Ignored if num_colors > 1.}

\item{zoom}{An optional vector of regions to zoom in on, written in the same
manner as geoid.name.}

\item{country_zoom}{An optional vector of countries to zoom in on, written as
they appear in the "adm0_a3" column of the object returned from
get_tract_map().}

\item{projection}{One of the following: "cartesian", "mercator", "robinson",
or "albers", for the equirectangular, Mercator, Robinson, and Albers Equal
Area projections, respectively. When using the Mercator projection for
world maps, setting limits_lon is recommended to prevent exaggeration of
the size of Antarctica.}

\item{limits_lat}{A length two vector giving the minimum and maximum latitude
you wish to include in your map.}

\item{limits_lon}{A length two vector giving the minimum and maximum
longitude you wish to include in your map.}

\item{reproject}{If TRUE, the map will be cropped and centered prior to
applying the projection. This will generally result in a better figure when
using the Robinson and Albers, but may lead to countries near the edge of
the map being occluded.}

\item{whitespace}{Add some blank space to the sides of your map? For some
projections, this must be set to FALSE in order for lat/lon ticks and
display correctly.}

\item{border_color}{The color of the borders on your map}

\item{border_thickness}{The thickness of the borders on your map}

\item{background_color}{The background color of your map}

\item{gridlines}{Should gridlines appear on your map?}

\item{latlon_ticks}{Should lat/lon tick marks appear on the edge of your map?}

\item{label}{The name of variable you wish to use to label your map; must be
one of the variables that appears in the spatial dataframe just prior
plotting (use return = 'sf' to see this dataframe), and in general, can be
any of the allowed geoid.type. This function uses ggplot2::geom_label_repel
to create the labels and ensure that they do not overlap.}

\item{label_text_size}{The size of the text that will appear in each label}

\item{label_text_color}{The color of the text that will appear in each label}

\item{label_box_color}{The color of the box around each label}

\item{ggrepel_options}{A list containing additional arguments to be passed to
geom_label_repel (see ?ggplot2::geom_label_repel)}

\item{legend}{A title for your legend; if NULL, value.name will be used.}

\item{legend_position}{The position of your legend relative to the rest of
the map; can be "top", "bottom", "left", or "right".}

\item{title}{A title for your plot; if NULL, no title will be added.}

\item{return}{If "plot", the function will return the requested map as a
ggplot object. If "sf", the function will return the spatial dataframe used
to draw the map (useful if you wish to customize the map yourself).}

\description{
This function can be used to plot regional data at the first sub-level of
administration (ie., state, province, prefecture, etc.) for one or more
countries. Use get_admin1_map() for an object which can help you coerce your
region names into the required format; see below for an example with Japanese
data.
}
\details{
Note: This function requires the package rnatrualearthhires, which is not
available on CRAN due to the filesize of the map being large. You can install
it using: \cr
remotes::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearthhires")
